# This program demonstrates how to set up a MPLS network that connects two
# customer edge (ce) routers `ce1` and `ce2` via two provider edge (pe) routers
# `pe1` and `pe2`, which are further connected via a provider (p) router. Only
# `pe` and `p` routers are MPLS enabled. `ce` routers do not use MPLS. The
# labels are assigned automatically using the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP).
# This program uses LDP from Free Range Routing (FRR) suite. Penultimate Hop
# Popping (PHP) is used in this program. Address helper is used to assign the
# IPv6 addresses to the interfaces, IPv4 addresses are added manually. Five ping
# packets are sent from `ce1` to `ce2`, and the success/failure of these packets
# is reported.
