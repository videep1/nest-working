# This program emulates point to point networks that connect two hosts `h1`
# and `h2` via two routers `r1` and `r2`. It is similar to the
# `udp-point-to-point-3.py` example in `examples/udp`. Instead of a UDP flow,
# two CoAP flows are configured from `h1` to `h2`, one for sending the GET
# requests and another for sending the PUT requests. `h1` acts as a CoAP client
# and `h2` acts as a CoAP server. Address helper is used in this program to
# assign IPv4 addresses.

# This program sends a total of 40 CoAP messages: 20 are GET requests and 20
# are PUT requests. Out of 20 messages that form the GET requests, 10 are
# confirmable messages (CON) and 10 are non-confirmable messages (NON). It is
# the same for 20 messages that form the PUT requests. The number of CON and
# NON messages can be configured with two variables `n_con_msgs` and
# `n_non_msgs`, respectively. The results obtained from this program are stored
# in a new directory called `coap-point-to-point-3(date-timestamp)_dump`. It
# contains a `README` which provides details about the sub-directories and
# files within this directory.

# the sender would never get a response. The `coap_non_timeout` parameter is
# required in such cases.
