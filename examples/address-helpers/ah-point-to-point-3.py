# This program emulates point to point networks that connect two hosts `h1` and
# `h2` via two routers `r1` and `r2`. Five ping packets are sent from `h1` to
# `h2`, and the success/failure of these packets is reported. It is similar to
# `point-to-point-3.py` available in `examples/basic-examples`, the only
# difference is that we use an address helper in this program to assign IPv4
# addresses to interfaces instead of manually assigning them. Note that two
# packages: `Network` and `AddressHelper` are imported in this program
# (Lines 8-9 above).
